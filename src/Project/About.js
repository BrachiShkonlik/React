        It all started when Avi and Yossi went out together to spend<br></br>
        When their stomach demanded its, they looked for a place to eat<br></br>
        But their disappointment was great-<br></br>
        The pizza they bought was dry, the ice was tasteless and the salad was curvaceously cut<br></br>
        Then they decided - no more!<br></br>
        They would open a pizza shop wich would respect itself and make everyone satisfied and satiated<br></br>
        And since then it's all history...<br></br>
        <br></br>
